    "faqTitle": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "faqSubtitle": "Find answers to common questions about delivery, shipping, and tracking",
    "faq1Q": "Which carrier will deliver my order?",
    "faq1A": "Parcels are being delivered depending on your choice upon checkout. For international deliveries it is possible to choose DPD or DHL. For national orders PostNL is possible to be selected.\\n\\nIf you have a question about the delivery of a parcel, please call DPD, DHL or PostNL.",
    "faq2Q": "What is Harts' delivery time?",
    "faq2A": "All our furniture is produced on backorder. General delivery time is 3 weeks.",
    "faq3Q": "Can I track my order's delivery?",
    "faq3A": "Yes, you can. You'll receive an email as soon as your order leaves our warehouse. The order can be tracked conveniently directly on our website with your order number. Didn't receive anything? Check your spam folder; it might have ended up there by mistake.",
    "faq4Q": "I didn't receive part of my order. What can I do?",
    "faq4A": "Your order may consist of multiple packages. It's possible that part of your order will arrive later than expected. If it hasn't arrived after a few days, please contact customer service.",
    "faq5Q": "Can I specify an alternative delivery address?",
    "faq5A": "Yes, you can during the checkout process. You can have your order delivered to your work, for example, or to someone else if that's the destination. After completion and payment, this is no longer possible through Xenos, but you can still change it via the DPD, DHL or PostNL website.",
    "faq6Q": "I won't be home at the time of delivery. What now?",
    "faq6A": "Are you not home at the time of delivery? You can indicate your preferences in the carrier's app, such as leaving it with a neighbor, leaving it in a safe place, or having it taken to a pickup point. You can use track & trace or the carrier's app to see where you can pick up your package. Important: once the carrier has left your package in a safe place, we are no longer liable for loss or damage.",
    "faq7Q": "Do you also deliver internationally?",
    "faq7A": "Yes, we deliver across all of Europe.",
    "faq8Q": "What are the benefits of choosing a DPD Parcel Point?",
    "faq8A": "If you choose delivery at a DPD Parcel Point, you don't have to wait at home for your order. This is convenient if, for example, you won't be home on the day of delivery. You can then pick up your order at your convenience. Choosing a Parcel Point is also a green choice! The more people choose this option, the fewer stops DPD's bus will have to make at home. This means fewer kilometers and less fuel.\\n\\nPlease note! The requirements for collecting a parcel from a DPD collection point are that the dimensions of the parcel must not be too large and the parcel must weigh a maximum of 20 kg.",
    "faq9Q": "What are the shipping costs?",
    "faq9A": "Shipping is free for orders over €400. Orders of €400 or less will be delivered to the parcel point for €10.99.",
    "faq10Q": "How long will my package be held at the collection point?",
    "faq10A": "DPD and DHL collection points will hold your package for one week. If the package isn't collected after one week, it will be returned to Harts' furniture warehouse.",
